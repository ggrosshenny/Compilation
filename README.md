# Compilation

## Description

This project is a school project. The aim is to build a compiler for a sub-langage of the C langage : the *StenC*. *StenC* is a langage created to make easier the application of *stencils code* (the *Sobel filter* is a good example of *stencils code*) and is based on a simplified *C* langage with only integer and a library of two functions (printi to print integers and printf to print strings).
